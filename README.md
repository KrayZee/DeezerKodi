# DeezerKodi
This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.
It works only for premium account and requires an account to access the service.
It supports access to your playlists, albums, artists and tracks. It allows for browsing the chart and radio.
Searching for tracks, albums and artists is also implemented.
It plays the .mp3 tracks in 128kb resolution only as that's the max available bitrate for TV's from Deezer.

The api client is a work in progress and in the future I will implement adding/removing operations to manage the library, because so far only data retrieval is supported.
