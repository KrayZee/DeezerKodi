# DeezerKodi
This is an unofficial Deezer addon for Kodi.
It works only for premium account and requires an account to access the service.
It supports access to your playlists, albums, artists and tracks. It allows for browsing the chart and radio.
Searching for tracks, albums and artists is also implemented.
It plays the .mp3 tracks in 128kb resolution only as that's the max available bitrate for TV's from Deezer.


# Installation
Please download the plugin from [the releases page](https://github.com/kubatek94/DeezerKodi/releases) to your Kodi box,
then install it in Kodi by selecting 'Install from zip file' option from the addons browser.
This addon is self-updating, so you'll have newest version automatically downloaded.
